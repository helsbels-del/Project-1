            <p>Pilates was developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkxhtfw0A8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="next word is a link to a video of Jpseph Pilates(opens in a new tab)">Joseph Pilates</a> from Mönchengladbach, Germany. His father was a gymnast and his mother a naturopath.

                Pilates said that the inspiration for his method came to him during World War I, while he was being held at the Knockaloe internment camp on the Isle of Man. Pilates spent four years there, working on his fellow internees, developing his method of a system of exercises intended to strengthen the human mind and body, believing that mental and physical health were interrelated.
                
                In his youth, Pilates had practiced many of the physical training regimens available in Germany, and it was from these that he developed his own method. It has clear connections with the physical culture of the late nineteenth century, such as the use of special apparatuses, and claims that the exercises could cure ill health. It is also related to the tradition of "corrective exercise" or "medical gymnastics" as typified by Pehr Henrik Ling.</p>
