# **Moving Cat Pilates Studio**
## **Introduction**
The Moving Cat Pilates Studio, is a fictional Pilates Studio that I have created a website for to help inform people about the history of Pilates and how it first came about and how, at the Moving Cat Pilates Studio’s around the UK, all the MC Pilates instructors, or the Elders, have been taught to the standards of Joseph Pilates who invented the Pilates moves back in the first world war helping injured soldiers. Aswell as being a club to join, via the join us page, and offering fixed classes and one-two-one sessions, the website includes a history page with a link to an informative animated video which tells the story of Pilates. It is targeted at a wide audience as Pilates is available for anyone at any level, from beginner to advanced. We offer a free taster session prior to joining so that the user can be sure it is something they would like to join and is important to introduce people who may not have done Pilates before and it can be quite a commitment to join a club without trying it first.

Background colour used rbg (161, 104, 104). I choose this as a nice earthy colour that fits the kind of colour scheme you would expect for a Pilates type of website. Calming colour that fits in with the other images throughout the website.
I have used this same colour in the footer as the background to match the header.
The Nav bar links to my other pages. The History page and the Join Us page.
This is in the same place on each page for consistency and makes it easy for the user to navigate from each page in the same way.
Index/Home page image.
I have included a background image of a silhouette of someone performing a well-known Salutation pose which will let people know straight away that the site is related to the Pilates/Yoga type industry. The colours and image give this calming effect also.
There is cover text overlaid on top of the image with a background effect to help the words stand out. Although the words on the home page would stand out ok against the background where it is positioned, I have included the background colour to match the History and Join Us pages which also have cover text and need the background colour to make the text stand out enough.
The cover text is a quote from Joseh Pilates, the founder of Pilates. I have put a quote from Joseh Pilates on each of the pages for consistency and to give the end user an interesting quote to read on each page to keep them interested.

Who are we section
Underneath the salutation image is a section with information about the club. The user will learn the locations of the studios and be interested to know that they can learn some of the history of Pilates by navigating to the History page. 
The background colour used here is rgba (161, 104, 104, 0.6) to give the same tone as the header and footer but lighter so that the black text stands out better and gives a good contrast with the header and footer colours.
